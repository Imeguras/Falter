# Falter

Welcome, fellow miners! Falter is a mod heavily inspired by thirst mod and Tough As Nails, unfortunately the first mentioned mod is kinda broken and the latter one is uncompatible with 1.7.10 which is my favourite version of minecraft to play in, specially when it comes to modding.

My favourite modpack is ftb infinity and although i've played it multiple times, sometimes in expert mode, i always find it "easy" to go around and lacking any flavour when it comes to immediate obstacles. So i decided to create this to possibly harden the difficulty without making it too annoying.
